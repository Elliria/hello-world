## This is a test
**Testing, testing...**
This template will not be used. This is because its name is ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md and it's inside of the .github directory, but it's not in the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE directory.

The YAML template will be used instead, because it's in the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE directory. It can have any name with the .yaml extension and I've just chosen to name it ISSUE_TEMPLATE_FORM.yaml in this example.

Note that if there was no .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE directory, then this template would be used for issue reports.
